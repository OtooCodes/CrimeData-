# Crime Data Analysis Project (2020 - Present)

## Objective
The Crime Data Analysis project aims to analyze crime data from 2020 to the present using Python. The primary focus is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to criminal activities over the specified period. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and the application of machine learning models to predict crime trends and identify hotspots.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- Proficiency in data visualization using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Experience with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
- Application of machine learning algorithms for crime prediction and classification.
- Development of data-driven insights to inform crime prevention strategies.

### Tools Used
- **Python** for data analysis and scripting.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding and documentation.

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection
- Downloaded crime data from open data sources (e.g., government databases, crime reports).
- Example: [Crime Data Source]([https://example.com/crime-data](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Pjlog0P9eaNWJ05cQlxnPSHbC5Fn49j?usp=drive_link))

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Normalized and encoded categorical variables.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed data distributions and correlations.
- Generated summary statistics and visualizations.
